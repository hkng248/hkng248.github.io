	<p><h2><u>My First Triathalon </u></h2> </p>
		<p> I signed up for my first triathlon (Ironman 70.3) on February 1, 2019.
			My race was on June 30, 2019. </p>

 <p><u> Training </u> </p>
 <p>Swimming :: Prior to this event, I was not an avid or confident swimmer.
	This event had a 1.2 mile (1931 meters) swim in open water with a 1 hour
	10 minute time cut off. I trained at Tony Drapolito Recreation Center
	(Monday, Tuesday, Thursday) and Chelsea Recreation Center (Sunday). I was my
	own coach, and I set my own standard “you will not leave this pool unless you
	swim 1.2 miles”. In the beginning it was difficult. It took me 1.5 hours to
	complete the swim in a clean chlorine  23 meter / 25 meter pool.
	I would come home drained and would consume all my food in my kitchen.
	However after a few weeks of struggle and hours in the pool, my stamina and
	confidence improved. I started increasing the distance to 1.5 miles
	(2414 meters), 2 miles (3218 meters), and my time to complete the
	distance gradually improved. I’m not a swim expert, my form is still
	questionable. </p>

<p>Bike :: I trained on a stationary bike at the Recreation Centers. I
 would bike for one hour, and during each session my target was to hit
 around 18-21 miles per hour. I did not own a bike and did not do any road
 tests with a rental bike. </p>

<p>Running :: Excluding rainy days, I ran & walked in New York City every day. I
	preferred to run or walk to my destination instead of using MTA (subway),
	because I thought this was the best way to get assimilated to the city and
	find new activities & meet new people (I met team EZ Money and Midnight
	Runners this way). On average I would commit to 3-5 miles a day.
	On Wednesdays I trained with Midnight Runners at their 5k boot camp,
	and on Fridays I played soccer at Pier 44. </p>

<p>Other training :: On Saturday mornings I trained with my Spartan race / obstacle
	 course race group. We focused on grip strength; upper body; burpees;
	 calisthenics. I also rucked. In my rucksack I carried a 30 pound ruck plate;
	 a 48 oz. bag of Tailwind; Cracking the Coding Interview. Whenever
	 I walked around the city I usually equipped my ruck. I lived in a 30-storey
	 apartment, so sometimes I would train in the fire exit staircase and
	 traverse up and down the flights of stairs (4-5 times). </p>

<p>Nutrition :: I was 100% committed to a very strict clean and healthy diet.
	Just kidding. I tried to commit to a “relatively” healthy diverse diet
	with reasonable portion sizes, however that did not happen. I ate whatever I
	wanted and consumed a lot of ice cream, fruits, and chocolate. The highlight of
	of training is eating.
 </p>

<p>My training schedule varied here and there, however I always made time for
	training or made up missed training sessions. Sometimes I would adjust and
	focus on a specific muscle group to prepare for an upcoming
	endurance event. </p>

<p><u>Saturday June 29th - Pre Race check in; Athlete Briefing</u></p>

<p>I rented a triathlon bike from Playtri. I have zero experience with triathlon
	 bikes and bikes in general. All I knew was how to ride a bike. This was my
	 first time riding a triathlon bike. When I was asked how I felt about the
	 fitting I just nodded and told them, “yeah that looks good”. I received a
	 154 Cervelo which is a standard fit for my height. I have no point of
	 reference if this was a good fit or not since this was my first time.
	 I said “I’m just going to improvise and work with what I got”. Prior to
	 checking in my bike in the transition zone, I gave it a test ride.
	 Triathlon bikes are fast. I rode this bike for about
	 30 minutes ( I want to assume I did about 5-6 miles), and did the basic
	 maneuvers; how do I stop; turn; shift gears. I struggled with turning
	 regardless if I was in the aero position or just standing upright. </p>

<p>After I checked in my bike in transition I did my first open water swim. I
	never swam in open water and I only used my wetsuit once. (I received my
	wetsuit on Friday June 28th and tested it at a high school near my house).
	I swam past the third buoy and was half way to the fourth buoy
	and I felt confident. I felt great until I looked back to shore
	and I realized I was by myself with no support. I started swimming back and
	when I looked up I thought I made no progress. I thought I was caught in a
	riptide or some sort of aquatic dead zone and I was fighting the current. At
	this point I experienced panic, dark thoughts hit me like the abdominal burn
	following a shot of strong tequila, “I’m kind of tired. No one knows where
	I am. I could die out here”. In the pool I would revert to breast stroke when
	fatigued. I started swimming back using breast stroke, it felt more taxing on
	my body compared to freestyle. At this point I thought “oh fuck, breast stroke
	 is not going to happen. I’m tired and I have about 350+ meters to go”, I got
	 tired of thinking and treading water so I flipped onto my back and started
	 flutter kicking  (I don’t know how to properly backstroke, and this was not
	 a time to experiment with the chicken-airplane-soldier stroke). I kicked
	 continuously for a long time and then reverted back to the freestyle. I just
	  passed the second buoy, I got this. After reaching the
		shore I reflected on what happened. It has been a while since I’ve felt that
		kind of panic. </p>

<p>For dinner I ate a balsamic chicken salad. I prefer to eat light the night
	before an endurance event. I prefer to consume and load up on carbohydrates
	2-3 days before the event. I went to bed that evening around 5:30pm since I
	was going to wake up at 3:30am. The pre-race anxiety was real. My mind was
	having an internal civil war. I don’t know why but my mind was toggling among
	third / second / first person, I assume that’s what happens when I’m in major
	stress. </p>

<p><i>Dark thoughts: </i>
	“Motherfucker you could have drowned today, and you want to go back? How the
	hell are you going to swim 1900+ meters when you only have 700 meters of open
	water swim experience? You have to ride 56 miles and you only rode 5-6 miles.
	Those training sessions in the gym and pool were not enough. You should have
	started with a shorter race. You should just drop out now, and come back
	when you are more prepared.” </p>

<p><i>Positive thoughts: </i>
	“You’ve been training since February.Stay positive, and stay calm.
	Remember, you shaved your head for this event. A DNF ( did not finish)
	or a DQ (disqualification) is better than a DNS (did not start).
	If you quit now, your mind will haunt you. Don’t fucking quit. DFQ”. </p>

<p>The dark thoughts prevailed the positive ones. All these thoughts of
	self-doubt; drowning; clouded my mind. At this point I just wanted to survive.
	My heart pounded as I forced myself to sleep. I thought to myself,
	“why did I sign up for this?” </p>

<p><u>Ironman 70.3 - Steelhead</u></p>

<p>
	3:30 am I woke up and I drowned all negative thoughts with music.:
	(The Script - Hall of Fame; Junoflo - Statues;   화사(Hwasa) -
	덤덤해지네 (Be Calm). Time to step up and finish what I have started.
	I have trained for this, and patiently waited for this moment.
	The only way I’m stopping is if they drag me off the course. Fuck it.
	Let’s do it. </p>

<p>
	Breakfast. I ate a clif protein bar mint flavored, peanut butter, and
	drank 3.18 PT of water. I reached the venue at 4:30 am, and setup my gear at
	transition zone. I placed everything in an orderly fashion so that when I hit
	transition during the race I know what I need to grab. Once my transition
	zone was settled I just lingered around the venues, headphones in, and
	mentally prepared myself for my first triathlon. </p>

<p><u>Swim (1.2 miles)</u> :: 6:45 am it was time to line up. In the pool I swim
	1.2 miles in about 50 minutes, so I went with the 50-55 minute wave.
	(I believe some triathlons divide the swim based on age, for this event we
	were able to choose what wave we would want to swim. You selected the wave
	based on how long you thought it would take to finish the swim). As I stood
	next to the 50-55 minute wave sign I met another experienced triathlete who
	I befriended. She was very kind, informative, answered all my questions, and
	helped calm my pre-race nervousness. Once I saw all the other triathletes,
	kayaks, and boats on stand-by support I felt a lot better. Face Everything
	And Rise. </p>

<p>The first 300 meters were absolute chaos. This was my first exposure to
	swimmer congestion. Everyone was kicking; flailing; people were overtaking &
	riding on each other; everyone was doing whatever they could to make forward
	progress. The first 100 meters I almost lost my green swim cap. I ended up
	carrying my swim cap in my right hand and then swimming to a kayak where I
	re-equipped it and continued. I passed a lot of people during my swim. I set
	small goals: I would reach a buoy; re-orient and re-align myself; sight out
	the next buoy then continue. I learned the day before that breast stroke was
	 more taxing on my body than the freestyle, if I felt fatigued I would flip
	 over onto my back, continue to flutter kick for about 7 seconds then flip
	 back over, sight my target and then swim towards that destination. I had no
	 idea what time it was, or how fast I was going, I just had one goal: if I
	 continue to pass people and no one passes me, I should be well within my
	 time hack. I finished the swim in 44 minutes. </p>

	<p><u>Transition I (Swim -> Bike)</u> :: When I got out of the water,
	 I was thankful to be alive. I was surprised I made the time hack.
	 On my way to my bike I started stripping down out of my wetsuit.
	 Once it was off I proceeded to put on: socks; running shoes; sunglasses;
	 sunscreen; nutrition. I scarfed down a few bites of my Clif protein bar mint,
	 drank my Powerade and water all at the same time. My mouth was like a
	 blender, and I vacuumed everything in an instant as I made my way to the
	 starting line for the bike portion. </p>

	<p><u>Bike (56 miles)</u> :: The first 8-9 miles of the bike was experimentation.
	 I have approximately 5-6 miles total experience on a Triathlon bike and I
	 have to do 56 miles. My plan was to mirror and observe what others were
	 doing and learn from them. I watched how the other bikers positioned
	 themselves in the aero position. <u>This was how I learned when to shift gears: </u>
	 I would count other riders’ pedal rotations. If their rotation count was
	 lower than mine and they were still going the same velocity as me that means
	 I have to adjust my gears because I'm probably overworking myself. I did
	 this for the first 8-9 miles. Eventually, I said to myself, “I don’t
	 think you know what you are doing, but as of now we need to move. Don’t stop,
	 just keep pedaling”. </p>

	<p>At mile 10 I saw the first aid station. We were informed during the athlete
	 briefing that the “bike aid stations would have a buffet consisting of:
	 bananas; gatorade; gu; protein bars; water. If you wanted to stop and help
	 yourself please pull over to the side”. Unfortunately, I blew right past it.
	 I was following the bikers who were ahead of me and watched them make a sharp
	 right turn. I thought they made this turn to pullover but they were actually
	 continuing on with the race. I struggled with making turns. Every turn
	 required a sharp deceleration, and my immediate attention. I tightened my
	 muscles and core at every turn in preparation of a possible fall. Aid
	 stations were 10 miles apart, I stopped at the next one (mile 20), refueled, and
	 then continued. After mile 30 I think I started getting the feel for the
	 bike, and how to shift gears in response to alternating elevation, uphills,
	 downhills, etc. (Just for the record, I’m not a bike expert or a person to
	 go to for bike advice. I just work with what I have, and try to make the best
	 of the situation). I finished the bike ride in 3 hours. </p>

	 <p><u>Transition II (Bike -> Run)</u> ::
	 I dropped off my bike equipment, re-applied sunscreen, grabbed my hat,
	 attached my bib number to my waist and then bolted. I finished the remainder
	 of my protein bar, Powerade, and water as I walked to the starting line for
	 the run. I felt I was entering my comfort zone. Two thirds of the triathlon
	 completed. Time to knock out the remaining 33.3%. </p>

	<p><u>Run (13.1 miles)</u> :: After the first mile, there was a major burning
	 sensation in my vastus medialis. I thought to myself “your muscle above your
	 knee cap are burning because you barely have any experience on a bike.
	 Regardless you are close to the finish. This is it. Don’t fucking quit”. </p>

<p>Similar and better than the aid stations during the bike, the aid stations
	 during the run also had an infinite supply of water; Gatorade (electrolytes);
	 Gu (I love GU); Red Bull (I drank so many of these during hackathons / all
	 nighters, so I avoid these); Coca-Cola; Cookies (morale); Pretzels & Chips
	 (salt); ice. It was an endurance athlete’s paradise. When I arrived at each
	 aid station I would drink two cups of water / Gatorade, and grab two cups of
	 ice water and splash myself in the face. My body was very sensitive to
	 nutrition so anything I ate gave me a boost. I consumed only GU, and
	 once in a while pretzels. It was hot. My body was on fire so I would drown
	 myself in ice water or fill my Triathlon suit with ice to help cool off. The
	 ice helped alleviate the growing pain and aches. I walked & jogged in small
	 increments. The last few miles I gunned it and gave it my all. I finished the
	 run in 2 hours 5 minutes </p>

<p>After I crossed the finish line, I met up with my parents. We exchanged
	 hugs and praise, and I re-synced up with some of the triathletes I befriended
	 along the event. I gathered my belongings from transition, and returned my
	 bike. Before I left I went for a quick  swim in Lake Michigan.
	 Cold water has never felt so good. </p>

<p><u>Conclusion</u> ::
	 If you asked me what is my definition of endurance. I would say “Endurance is
	 when you are in pain, but you continue to move forward. Quitting is not an option.
	 Do whatever it takes to get the job done. Period.” </p>

<p>I believe that the mind and body are two separate entities. Your body may be
	 sending pain signals trying to convince your mind, “you motherfucker please
	 fucking stop what you are doing”, however you have to train your mind to
	 send a reply message to your body, “hey shut the fuck up we are finishing this”.
	 The mind will always prevail over the body. Every stroke, pedal, and step is
	 progress and it’s important that you do not quit.
	 </p>

<p>I love the endurance community. I think there is a subtle bond that is shared
	 with people who embark on endurance challenges together. Suffering together brings
	 people together.
	 </p>

<p>I believe all people share one commonality that aligns and defines us:
	 We train and commit to our craft to become abetter version of
	 ourselves from yesterday. If our goals align, let us help each other to
	 become better. </p>

<p>Thank you for listening, <br>
